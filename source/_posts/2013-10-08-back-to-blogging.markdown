**Back to Blogging**

I caved.

I'm using Octopress for blogging right now, since I'm just a little too busy to start/finish/make progress on my own CMS solution.  I've avoided using Octopress because, although it's mighty cool, I want to have total control over everything I put into my blog and not have to rely on Disqus for comments or an external service for searching, etc.  I don't really care if I've got NIH syndrome.  I also am desperate to post the deluge of kitten pictures that I have.

Anyway, I like things so far, but I will be using this as a learning opportunity to port Octopress->my CMS.

I've got lots to write about, mostly notes I've gathered whilst at my current job, which will, with any luck, generate enormous amounts of ad revenue and make me rich.
